# hello-world

Hello,

I am an Egyptian citizen with 2 Bachelor Degrees, a Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor of English Literature. I also have some international certificates like IELTS Academic and ICDL. I have a long experience in Translation, Interpretation and Teaching. I taught at 2 schools in Greece in 2016 in a voluntary work with AIESEC University of Aegean. Currently I work as a Translator and Interpreter at an Import and Export Company, and as an English Language Teacher at the Ministry of Defense Language Institute in Alexandria, Egypt.

I always strive to educate myself, and I have even started to study German. Continuing education is simply a lifestyle for me and that inspires my students and clients so much. So, I hope to be a good addition to you.

THAT'S ME!

Thank you
